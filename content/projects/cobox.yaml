body: 'A React/Gatsby website with a Wordpress CMS. <a href="https://www.cobox.com.au/"
  title="https://www.cobox.com.au/">https://www.cobox.com.au/</a><br><br>I experimented
  with using Nextjs for this project, before settling on Gatsby for it''s speed. Build
  times are far slower, but site load times are faster.<br><br>The initial design
  and development went through multiple rounds of internal and external feedback before
  landing on something that was friendly and evoked the personality of the brand.<br><br>To
  implement, I broke the site down into three parts: Front page, dynamic project pages
  and content management. As Gatsby uses graphql I needed a cms solution that would
  work but was also aware of user familiarity with Wordpress. I decided to setup a
  headless Wordpress backend with advanced custom fields. This data was then transformed
  to graphql at build time.<br><br>The front page is broken up into multiple, scrollable
  sections. This allowed me to develop individual components that had their own logic,
  such as the sortable projects section.<br><br>Finally, individual projects are generated
  at build time using a template. I created a simple block editor in Wordpress to
  manage and arrange custom components. This allowed posts to all have unique layouts
  but with hard, visual constraints.'
