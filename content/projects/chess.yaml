  created by Andrew Morris <a href="https://andrewmorris.io/" title="https://andrewmorris.io/">https://andrewmorris.io/</a><br><br>Apart
  from the game logic, I created this entire application from scratch using React.
  The process began as a simple challenge: produce an Isometric chess game. This was
  motivated purely by creative and technical curiosity... I think playing chess in
  an isometric perspective is far from ideal and unnecessarily confusing.<br><br>My
  approach was to break all the visible elements into unique components and assemble
  them on an SVG canvas. The board itself was created from a single tile, which had
  different animations based on its state (colour, active, hovered, etc.). Because
  the pieces were more complex, these were created in Illustrator and exported as
  SVGs.<br><br>I also implemented a dynamic switch for whether it is 2 player or versus
  a computer. The game does not need to be restarted for this to take effect.'
