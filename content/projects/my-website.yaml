  goal was to create a website that reflected my passion for character design and
  minimalist interfaces. The character animations and illustrations were created in
  after effects and exported as JSON files, for use with the Lottie library from Airbnb.
  To generate the static layouts I used gatsby, deploying to Netlify. Finally, the
  CMS is forestry.io, which I chose for its simplicity of use.
