body: A project management tool for cataloging videos and project assets with query-able
  data. Created in React with a Firebase backend.<br><br>This project arose out of
  need for a simpler method of sourcing historical files. Previously we were using
  our local file system and querying for file names directly. I conducted initial
  research to identify what solutions existed for this problem. There are many project
  and file management platforms, but we needed something simple that conformed to
  our existing data structure.<br><br>I began the project by developing wire frames
  and collecting internal feedback. This progressed to a final design that adhered
  to pre-existing brand guidelines in regards to colour and form.<br><br>I developed
  the platform using React with Redux. The Redux state was automatically updated by
  event listeners connected to a firestore database which could than be accessed in
  individual components.<br><br>The biggest tech challenge of this project was the
  remote storage feature. All the files are stored in google cloud storage, potentially
  scaling to many terabytes. To mitigate cost overheads I used cloud functions to
  automatically convert files flagged as "archival" to a cold storage class. These
  files are then synced with the database for easy access.
