  mobile PWA i made to keep track of head to head scores with my partner. We like
  to play board games and compete in all manner of ways, and over time we realised
  we were both keeping a heavily disputed, running tally. My solution to this problem
  was to make an app... which i think is a perfectly normal response.<br><br>I began
  by doing design and technical research. The design was clear to me from the beginning,
  as I wanted something very friendly, with a refined user experience. In regards
  to the tech, I've had a lot of experience with react and creating mobile layouts,
  but I really wanted to make something installable. This lead me to the Ionic framework,
  which I preferred over React Native as it uses web components.<br><br>The app itself
  connects to a simple firebase database, with google authentication. The biggest
  challenge was creating a service worker that notified the user about updates.
