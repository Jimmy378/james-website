body: A browser based video player made with React for retrieving timecodes and screenshots.<br><br>Internally
  we had a need to quickly retrieve timecode stamped screenshots from videos to send
  to clients. Using existing software was fine, but it didn't format the file names
  properly and digging into the file system was a two step process. I decided to build
  a small tool to eliminate that second step and format the file names on screenshot.<br><br>The
  tool behaves very simply, drag or upload a video into the browser, play and scrub
  the video and tap the screenshot button to retrieve. This functionality is achieved
  by drawing the current frame to HTML canvas. An object url is then generated from
  the resulting file and downloaded in the browser for easy access.
